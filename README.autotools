1. Introduction
---------------

This package installs  a the C language library Hoedown,  a revived fork
of  Sundown, the  Markdown  parser based  on the  original  code of  the
Upskirt library by Natacha Port√©.

  This distribution is a repackaging of the original code, making use of
the GNU Autotools and it is tested on a GNU+Linux system.


2. License
----------

See the LICENSE file.


3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd hoedown-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/hoedown

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/hoedown

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd hoedown
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install
