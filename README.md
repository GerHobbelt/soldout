# Greenmat

**Greenmat** is a Ruby library for Markdown processing, based on [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet).

It's a core module of [qiita-markdown](https://github.com/increments/qiita-markdown) gem and not intended for direct use. If you are looking for Qiita-specified markdown processor, use qiita-markdown gem.

## Versioning Policy

Greenmat follows Redcarpet's updates by merging the upstream changes.
The version format is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.FORK`.
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is the same as the version of Redcarpet that Greenmat is based on. `FORK` is incremented on each release of Greenmat itself and reset to zero when any of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is bumped.

## Acknowledgment
